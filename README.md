# FitLogApi-Server
**Work in Progress**

**Premise of idea stems from time spent providing personal training services. Clients are generally given instructions for cardio sessions outside of the time they pay for with an actual trainer. This simple app provides a "log" of cardio session's to serve a couple of different purposes. The first being to provide a visual representation of work done over time in the form of various data visualizations. Secondly, to allow for the user to provide accurate measureables for the trainer to more appropriately gauge a client's progress and needs.
